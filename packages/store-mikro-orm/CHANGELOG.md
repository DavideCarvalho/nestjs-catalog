### Patch Changes

- 21b2d71: Ship a README

  The package published with none, so its npm page was blank — for the one adapter whose
  misconfiguration is silent. `contextName` is the option worth reading before installing: omit it and
  the store resolves the _default_ EntityManager, creating the catalog's tables and loading every
  snapshot into the host application's schema, with no error raised, because writing to the wrong
  database is not a type error and the rows land successfully.

  Also documents keeping a host's migration differ away from the library's tables
  (`catalogManagedTables()`, `MARKER_TABLE`, and why `obj_*` is deliberately absent from both).
