### Minor Changes

- f1100ba: Enforce per-type write grants across the pipeline surface, stop serving connection passwords, and make a deleted connector actually stop retrying.

  **Behaviour change: the pipeline routes now authorise, not just attribute.** `mayWrite` had call sites in one file — `publish.service.ts` — and none on this surface. Every route here read `request.principal` for `?.id ?? 'console'` and used it as a name to write in a log, so a principal holding `catalog:write` with `writeTypes: ["Mvr"]` could author a workflow whose sink commits `Subwo`, attach a connector, and run it. Nothing lied on the way through: the graph validated, the run succeeded, and the snapshot recorded the write as authorised.

  Four routes now refuse. `POST /pipeline/workflows` and `POST /pipeline/connectors` check at save time, which is the gate the scheduled path depends on — a cron-fired run carries a synthetic scheduler id with no grants to consult, so the question has to have been answered when the graph was written down. `POST /pipeline/workflows/:id/run` and `POST /pipeline/connectors/:id/run` check again at run time, which catches what save time cannot see: a graph saved by a principal that held the grant, run by one that does not. Types are read off **every** sink, not off `WorkflowRow.targetType`, which records only the first sink a multi-sink graph declares.

  A host may now be refused for: saving or running a workflow whose sink commits a type outside the principal's `writeTypes`; saving a connector whose `targetType` is outside it, or one attached to a workflow whose sinks are; running either. Refusals are `403` and name every type they turned down.

  **Behaviour change: these routes now require a principal.** `saveConnection`, `saveConnector`, `saveTransform`, `saveWorkflow`, and both run routes previously fell back to attributing the write to `'console'` when no guard had put a principal on the request. They now fail the way `createPublishController` already did, because a caller with no identity has no grants to check and "allow everything when nobody is identified" is the bug being fixed. **A deployment that mounts `CatalogPipelineModule` without a principal guard will start failing these routes.**

  **Behaviour change: a connection URL carrying a password is no longer accepted or served.** `ConnectorRow.config`, `ConnectionRow.config` and `sources.ts` all promise that a credential is never stored — only the _name_ of an environment variable. That held for token-based sources and not for SQL, where `fetchSql` reads `config.url` and `postgres://user:pass@host/db` is a password with an address attached. `config` was persisted verbatim, returned verbatim, and served by `GET /pipeline/connections` and `GET /pipeline/connectors`, both of which ask only for `catalog:read`.

  Two halves, because neither alone is enough:

  - `MySqlPipelineStore.saveConnector` and `saveConnection` refuse a password-bearing URL in `config` that is not already the stored value for that row. Refused in the store rather than the controller, because a connector saved by curl, by a host's own code, or by `applyPromotion` reaches it and nothing else. **A host may now be refused for** creating a connector or connection whose config carries such a URL, changing an existing one's to a different password-bearing URL, or **promoting such a connector into an environment that does not have it yet** — `promoteConnectors` already refuses to carry `secretEnvVar` across so a promoted connector "arrives with no credential", and this applies that rule to the credential that was hiding inside `config`. Move the URL into an environment variable and name it in `secretEnvVar`. Rows already in the table are grandfathered and keep running.
  - The four read routes that serve connectors and connections redact the password on the way out. This is what covers the rows that are already stored. It is at the route and not in the store on purpose: `ConnectorRunnerService` resolves the connector it is about to run through the store, and `applyPromotion` copies connectors between environments by reading them from it — a store that redacted would hand the runner a URL that cannot connect and promote the placeholder into the next environment as though it were the password.

  A console that reads a connector, edits it and posts the whole object back is safe: the save routes put the stored credential back when the value they receive is exactly the redaction of what is held.

  **Fix: `FatalError` in the connector step now actually stops the retries.** `connector-run.steps.ts` documented that a deleted or disabled connector must not be retried and did not achieve it. `FatalError` carries `message` and `code` and no `retryable`; durable core honours the class itself only in `runStepHandler`'s local retry loop, while a dispatched step is judged by `existing.error?.retryable !== false` on a serialised envelope. All three attempts were burning over roughly fifteen minutes for a connector somebody deleted on purpose. Fixed the way `workflow-run.steps.ts` already had been, by extending `FatalError` with `readonly retryable = false` so both paths are correct.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 0fe6d6f: Clear the lint backlog — 63 warnings to 0, mostly by extraction

  Behaviour is unchanged throughout; what moved is where the code lives.

  **Two `any`s in `sources.ts`** became interfaces declaring only the methods this
  package calls, with rows staying `unknown[]` because that is the boundary where
  the type genuinely is unknown. No assertions were added.

  **Two functions were doing several separable jobs.** `planPromotion` (61) split
  into a section per kind, and `validateWorkflow` (75) into the checks its own
  comments already named. `workflowRunOrder` now reuses `buildAdjacency` rather
  than rebuilding its own indegree map — its docstring already argued that "two
  implementations of one rule is how a graph that validated comes out executing
  differently", and it was doing exactly that.

  **The vendored chart files are handled by config, not by comments.** 79 files
  under `charts/bklit/` carry a header promising "nothing else is modified, so
  re-syncing with upstream stays a diff rather than a merge". A scoped `overrides`
  entry keeps that promise, and it made nine pre-existing suppressions redundant —
  so those files now have FEWER local edits than before, not more.

  **Three suppressions survive, each with the reason written beside it:**

  - A telescope event renderer whose docblock asserts every branch emits only
    names, never data. That is a security property auditable in one screen
    precisely because the branches are adjacent; splitting them into four
    functions would spread it where it can no longer be read at once.
  - `SelectField`'s `<label>`: `Select` renders a BUTTON, and a label does not
    implicitly name a button — which is why `Select` already required an
    accessible name of its own. `ariaLabel` now defaults to `label` so the common
    case cannot forget it, while still allowing the fuller name the call sites
    deliberately use ("Kind" on screen, "Connection kind" announced).
  - `Switch`'s `<label>`, which DOES resolve — Base UI renders a hidden native
    input inside the root, so the implicit association works and the rule simply
    cannot see through the component boundary. A new spec asks for the control by
    its accessible name, so the suppression's claim is checked rather than
    asserted.

  **`planPromotion` had no test at all**, which is a poor place for the largest
  refactor in the batch: it decides what moves between environments, and a wrong
  plan promotes something that should have been withheld or withholds something an
  operator is waiting on, neither of which throws. It now has 37, mutation-checked
  — including the cross-section exception where connectors are planned last and
  handed what the earlier sections produced, so a connector whose transform is
  arriving in the same promotion is accepted rather than blocked.

  The two deliberate NUL bytes — a sentinel in `stable()` and a separator in the
  query cache key — are now written as escapes rather than raw bytes. Same value;
  git stops calling those files binary and `grep` stops silently finding nothing
  in them.

### Minor Changes

- 5d10b69: Serve the workflow routes the console asks for

  The controller was ported without its five workflow endpoints, so the Ingestion
  › Workflows screen answered `Cannot GET …/pipeline/workflows`. They are back:
  `GET`/`POST` `workflows`, `DELETE workflows/:id`, `POST workflows/:id/run` and
  `GET workflows/:id/connectors`.

  `WorkflowLauncher` is registered and exported alongside them — a route that can
  list workflows but not start one is a screen with a button that 404s.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 64ad4f0: Stop naming one consumer in a public library

  The pipeline package was extracted from an application's copy of the engine, and the extraction
  carried that application's name into comments, a docblock, a seams table — and into a **runtime error
  message**, which shipped advice about one host's durable module to every consumer that hit it.

  Nothing was wrong with the _reasoning_ in those places; only with whose name it was told through. It
  now describes the situation rather than the application: "a host with separate API and worker
  processes", "a multi-environment host", "either this host mounts no durable engine, or its durable
  module failed to bind".

  `catalog.principal.ts` had the same slip in an older comment, so that goes too.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 6f739d9: Ship the pipeline and publish controllers

  The engine moved into this package but its HTTP surface did not, so the 19 routes under
  `<path>/pipeline` and `<path>/publish` stayed hand-written in every host — the same duplication the
  engine had, one level up.

  They are factories, matching `createCatalogController`: the route prefix and the guards come from
  `forRoot`, because a library that hardcodes the auth for routes which can rewrite a catalog's schema
  is deciding something only the host can. Omit `path` and no controllers are mounted at all, which is
  what a worker-only host wants.

  `@dudousxd/nestjs-catalog` now owns the vocabulary those routes declare with — `RequireScopes`,
  `RequireHuman`, and the two metadata keys behind them. It already owned `CatalogScope`,
  `CatalogPrincipal` and `hasScope`, and the alternative is every package that ships routes inventing
  its own key, which would force a host to write one guard per package instead of one guard for the
  catalog. Declaring stays separate from enforcing: the library says what a route needs, the host's
  guard decides who the caller is.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- af85ebe: Export `SubprocessTransformRunner`

  A host that declares its own pipeline controllers needs it, and Nest resolves a controller's
  dependencies from the module that declares the controller — so without the export the host fails at
  boot with `Nest can't resolve dependencies of the PipelineController ... SubprocessTransformRunner at
index [1] is available in the ... module`.

  Exported rather than left to the host to provide, because this module owns the configured instance:
  it is the one built with `pythonVenv`. A host supplying a second one would be running transforms
  through a runner configured somewhere else, which is the kind of difference that only shows up when a
  transform cannot find its interpreter.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- d00c67d: The connector pipeline, as a package

  Fetch, transform, publish was application code in two places at once: the standalone catalog service
  and a copy of it mounted inside another app. The two had already drifted — one of them was missing
  the scheduler entirely, so `connector.schedule` was a column nothing acted on until it was ported by
  hand. That is the failure duplication always produces eventually, and it is why this is a package.

  Two things the engine cannot decide for itself are injected rather than imported, because the two
  applications it came from disagreed on both:

  - `CATALOG_PIPELINE_EM` resolves the EntityManager a write lands on. It is a **function**, not a
    value: a multi-environment host picks the connection per call, and a value captured at construction
    would pin every write to whichever environment was current at boot. Writing to the wrong database
    is not a type error and the rows land successfully.
  - `CATALOG_PIPELINE_REGISTRY` is the registry the engine reads the model from — only `reload()` and
    `getType()`, which is all either application used.

  `CATALOG_PIPELINE_SCOPE` covers the third difference. A durable step is a message off a queue and a
  scheduler tick is a timer callback, so neither carries an ambient scope; a host routing one store
  across several environments enters one, and a single-connection host binds the pass-through default
  and pays nothing.

  The scheduler's "should this process poll?" is an option instead of the `APP_TYPE` check the copy
  carried, which was one host's role split leaking into shared code.
