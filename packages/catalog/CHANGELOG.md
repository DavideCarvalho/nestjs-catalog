### Patch Changes

- 64ad4f0: Stop naming one consumer in a public library

  The pipeline package was extracted from an application's copy of the engine, and the extraction
  carried that application's name into comments, a docblock, a seams table — and into a **runtime error
  message**, which shipped advice about one host's durable module to every consumer that hit it.

  Nothing was wrong with the _reasoning_ in those places; only with whose name it was told through. It
  now describes the situation rather than the application: "a host with separate API and worker
  processes", "a multi-environment host", "either this host mounts no durable engine, or its durable
  module failed to bind".

  `catalog.principal.ts` had the same slip in an older comment, so that goes too.

### Minor Changes

- 6f739d9: Ship the pipeline and publish controllers

  The engine moved into this package but its HTTP surface did not, so the 19 routes under
  `<path>/pipeline` and `<path>/publish` stayed hand-written in every host — the same duplication the
  engine had, one level up.

  They are factories, matching `createCatalogController`: the route prefix and the guards come from
  `forRoot`, because a library that hardcodes the auth for routes which can rewrite a catalog's schema
  is deciding something only the host can. Omit `path` and no controllers are mounted at all, which is
  what a worker-only host wants.

  `@dudousxd/nestjs-catalog` now owns the vocabulary those routes declare with — `RequireScopes`,
  `RequireHuman`, and the two metadata keys behind them. It already owned `CatalogScope`,
  `CatalogPrincipal` and `hasScope`, and the alternative is every package that ships routes inventing
  its own key, which would force a host to write one guard per package instead of one guard for the
  catalog. Declaring stays separate from enforcing: the library says what a route needs, the host's
  guard decides who the caller is.
