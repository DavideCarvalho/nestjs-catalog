## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 6da500a: Export the types `CatalogDirectory` is written in

  `CATALOG_DIRECTORY` and `CatalogDirectory` shipped without
  `CatalogDirectoryQuery` or `CatalogPeoplePage` — the argument and the return of
  the one method a host is expected to implement. Implementing the seam meant
  restating both by hand.

  The barrel now re-exports the module wholesale rather than naming members, since
  the failure was a list that fell behind the file it was listing.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 5d10b69: Serve the Access screen, through a directory the host can own — and page it.

  `GET /access/principals`, `GET /access/people` and `POST /access/people` had no
  server implementation at all. The React screens called endpoints nothing
  answered, so the whole screen read as a broken build.

  They are now served from `CATALOG_DIRECTORY`, split along who actually owns the
  answer. Applications come from `catalog_principal` and are shipped:
  `CatalogMikroOrmStoreModule` binds `MikroOrmCatalogDirectory` and hosts get that
  half for free. People are the host's — `listPeople` and `upsertPerson` are
  optional, and a directory implementing neither is a complete implementation
  rather than a half-finished one, because a catalog embedded in an application is
  embedded in one that already has a user store. Standing up a second one beside
  it is how you get two lists of employees that disagree about who was offboarded.

  An unimplemented half answers **501 naming the seam** instead of returning an
  empty list, so an operator can tell "not wired" from "nobody is there".

  **`listPeople` is paged, and the bound is not advisory.** The host's user table
  is its whole directory, so `GET /access/people` takes `search`/`limit`/`offset`,
  caps the limit at 500 whatever is asked for, and hands the query DOWN to the
  directory so it reaches the database rather than slicing a list that was already
  materialised. The response is a page carrying `total`, and the screen renders
  "Showing 1–50 of 1,340" plus a search box — a bounded list that cannot report
  what it is bounding is indistinguishable from a complete one, and an operator
  reading it as complete concludes somebody has no access when they were merely on
  the next page.

  Bind your own directory with the new `directory` option on
  `CatalogModule.forRoot` — via the option rather than only exporting the token
  from an imported module, since a provider declared inside the module shadows one
  exported by its imports. Routes mount at the new `accessPath`, a sibling of
  `path` by default.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 64ad4f0: Stop naming one consumer in a public library

  The pipeline package was extracted from an application's copy of the engine, and the extraction
  carried that application's name into comments, a docblock, a seams table — and into a **runtime error
  message**, which shipped advice about one host's durable module to every consumer that hit it.

  Nothing was wrong with the _reasoning_ in those places; only with whose name it was told through. It
  now describes the situation rather than the application: "a host with separate API and worker
  processes", "a multi-environment host", "either this host mounts no durable engine, or its durable
  module failed to bind".

  `catalog.principal.ts` had the same slip in an older comment, so that goes too.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 6f739d9: Ship the pipeline and publish controllers

  The engine moved into this package but its HTTP surface did not, so the 19 routes under
  `<path>/pipeline` and `<path>/publish` stayed hand-written in every host — the same duplication the
  engine had, one level up.

  They are factories, matching `createCatalogController`: the route prefix and the guards come from
  `forRoot`, because a library that hardcodes the auth for routes which can rewrite a catalog's schema
  is deciding something only the host can. Omit `path` and no controllers are mounted at all, which is
  what a worker-only host wants.

  `@dudousxd/nestjs-catalog` now owns the vocabulary those routes declare with — `RequireScopes`,
  `RequireHuman`, and the two metadata keys behind them. It already owned `CatalogScope`,
  `CatalogPrincipal` and `hasScope`, and the alternative is every package that ships routes inventing
  its own key, which would force a host to write one guard per package instead of one guard for the
  catalog. Declaring stays separate from enforcing: the library says what a route needs, the host's
  guard decides who the caller is.
